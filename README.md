# new-site

This website was a coding challenge given to me by a company to assess my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
This was built desktop first, because I wasn't given a design file for mobile or tablet.
I am more familiar building mobile first, so it was a bit of a challenge for me to figure out how it should look for tablet and mobile.
The image carousel was new for me, so I had to source the code online to figure out how to implement.
I also had to do a bit of research to figure out how to make the nav bar change color upon scrolling, in desktop version.
Overall, this project was a good challenge for me.
